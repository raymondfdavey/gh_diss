Ok so made a lot of progress today.
- off back of ivors advice am using windows machines and just being gentle with the pip and conda installs
- taking each error at a time having done a basic install 
- all saved to the my_env conda env

- so, now i'm set up and have be running and rerunning the actual script for training and evaluating the model. 
- I have got a lot working but most recently got stuck on the naming convention of my DATA!!!!
- so action plan for tomorrow is:
		- use the script from GPT to rename the 'final' directory filenames
		- do a little test first you hasty bastart
		- and then do for all
		- and then add that into the pipeline I build before
- Once that is ok then continue to run and test and poke and prod their version
- Ideally producing anomaly maps 

- I then also want to compare my data with their data
- I then want to compare models trained with both.
