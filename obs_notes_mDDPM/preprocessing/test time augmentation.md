Certainly! Let's dive deeper into these concepts:

Test Time Augmentation (TTA) and Mirroring:

1. Test Time Augmentation (TTA):
   TTA is a technique used to improve the robustness and accuracy of predictions. The idea is to create multiple versions of the input data during testing, make predictions on each version, and then aggregate these predictions.

2. Mirroring:
   In the context of HD-BET, mirroring is a specific form of TTA. When `do_mirroring` is True, the input image is flipped along various axes, predictions are made on these flipped versions, and then the results are combined.

In `predict_case.py`, you can see this process:

```python
if do_mirroring:
    x = 8
else:
    x = 1
```

When mirroring is enabled, it creates 8 versions of the input (original + 7 mirrored versions), effectively multiplying the number of predictions by 8.

Impact on the process:
- When TTA/mirroring is enabled, it increases the accuracy but also significantly increases computation time.
- Disabling TTA (setting `-tta 0`) reduces computation time but might slightly reduce accuracy.

Regarding MPS usage and CPU fallback:

The `upsample_trilinear3d` operation is part of the network's upsampling layers, which are crucial in reconstructing the full-resolution output from the lower-resolution features. While it's an important operation, it's not the only operation in the network.

Processes still using MPS:
1. Convolution operations
2. Activation functions (like ReLU)
3. Normalization layers
4. Most tensor operations

Processes falling back to CPU:
1. `upsample_trilinear3d` operation

The impact of this fallback depends on the network architecture, but generally:
- Most of the heavy computation (convolutions, which often account for the majority of operations in a CNN) is still done on MPS.
- The upsample operation, while important, is typically not as computationally intensive as convolutions.

However, the fallback does introduce some overhead:
1. Data transfer between MPS (GPU) and CPU memory
2. Synchronization between MPS and CPU operations

This overhead can impact performance, especially if the upsample operation is called frequently in the network.

To give you a more precise assessment of the impact, we'd need to profile the specific HD-BET implementation. However, given that the script runs much faster with MPS (even with the fallback) compared to running entirely on CPU, it suggests that MPS is still handling a significant portion of the computation.

If you're curious about the exact impact, you could try timing the script with different settings:
1. Full MPS with fallback
2. CPU only
3. MPS with fallback, but timing specifically the upsample operations

This would give you a clearer picture of how much time is spent on the fallback operation versus the MPS-accelerated parts.
