To preprocess a new set of MRI scans and make them compatible with the existing model, you would need to follow the same preprocessing steps described in the pipeline. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you would need to do:

1. Obtain the new MRI scans:
   - Acquire the new set of MRI scans in a suitable file format (e.g., NIfTI, DICOM) from the imaging source or database.
   - Ensure that the scans are of sufficient quality and cover the desired brain regions.

2. Set up the preprocessing environment:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary software and tools installed, such as the HD-BET tool for skull-stripping.
   - Clone the HD-BET repository from GitHub and follow the installation instructions provided.
   - Set up any other dependencies or libraries required for the preprocessing pipeline.

3. Organize the data:
   - Create a new directory for the new dataset within the "preprocessing" directory.
   - Place the MRI scans in this new directory, ensuring that they are named and organized consistently.

4. Adapt the preprocessing script:
   - Create a new bash script for the new dataset, similar to the existing scripts in the "preprocessing" directory.
   - Modify the script to point to the correct input and output paths for the new dataset.
   - Adjust any dataset-specific parameters or settings if necessary.

5. Run the preprocessing pipeline:
   - Navigate to the "preprocessing" directory in your terminal or command prompt.
   - Execute the bash script for the new dataset to initiate the preprocessing pipeline.
   - The script will perform the following steps:
     a. Resample the MRI scans to 1.0 mm voxel size.
     b. Skull-strip the scans using the HD-BET tool to remove non-brain tissue.
     c. Register the skull-stripped scans to the SRI Atlas to bring them into a common coordinate space.
     d. Remove any black borders surrounding the brain images.
     e. Apply N4 bias correction to correct for intensity inhomogeneities.

6. Verify the preprocessed data:
   - After the preprocessing pipeline finishes, check the output directory for the preprocessed MRI scans.
   - Visually inspect a few samples to ensure that the preprocessing steps were applied correctly and the brain images look as expected.

7. Integrate the preprocessed data into the model:
   - Update the model's data loading or input pipeline to include the new preprocessed dataset.
   - Ensure that the model can correctly load and process the new data alongside the existing datasets.

By following these steps, you can preprocess a new set of MRI scans and make them compatible with the existing model. The key is to maintain consistency in the preprocessing steps and ensure that the new data undergoes the same transformations as the original datasets used to train the model.

It's important to note that depending on the characteristics of the new dataset, you may need to fine-tune or retrain the model to achieve optimal performance. The preprocessed new data can be used for inference or further analysis using the existing model architecture.
