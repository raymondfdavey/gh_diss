Certainly! Let me explain the concept of masking and the different approaches used in the paper in a more intuitive way.

Masking is a technique commonly used in computer vision and image processing to selectively hide or reveal certain parts of an image. It's like placing a "mask" over an image, where the mask determines which pixels are visible and which are not.

In the context of the paper, the authors use masking as a regularization technique to improve the performance of their anomaly detection method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). They explore three different masking approaches:

1. Image Patch-Masking (IPM):
Imagine you have a clean, healthy brain MRI image. In IPM, the authors randomly select small rectangular regions (patches) within the image and apply a mask to those patches. The mask sets the pixel values within the selected patches to zero, effectively hiding the information in those regions.

The masked image is then fed into the DDPM, which is trained to reconstruct the original, unmasked image. By doing this, the DDPM learns to fill in the missing information in the masked regions based on the surrounding context.

2. Frequency Patch-Masking (FPM):
In FPM, the masking is performed in the frequency domain rather than the spatial domain. The authors first convert the image to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In the frequency domain, the image is represented by its frequency components, which capture different levels of detail and texture.

The authors then apply a mask to certain frequency components, effectively removing or suppressing those components. This is similar to applying a filter in the frequency domain. The modified frequency representation is then converted back to the spatial domain using the inverse FFT, resulting in a modified image.

The modified image is fed into the DDPM, which is trained to reconstruct the original, unmodified image. By masking in the frequency domain, the DDPM learns to capture and reconstruct the important frequency components of the image.

3. Frequency Patch-Masking CutMix (FPM-CM):
FPM-CM combines the ideas of FPM and a technique called CutMix. In CutMix, patches from one image are cut and pasted onto another image, creating a new composite image.

In FPM-CM, the authors first apply FPM to the image, obtaining a modified image in the frequency domain. They then randomly select patches from the modified image and paste them onto the corresponding locations in the original, clean image.

The resulting composite image contains both the original, clean regions and the modified, "anomalous" patches. The DDPM is then trained to reconstruct the original, clean image from this composite image. By doing this, the DDPM learns to identify and remove the anomalous patches, effectively detecting anomalies.

The key idea behind these masking approaches is to create artificial anomalies or perturbations in the training images. By training the DDPM to reconstruct the original, clean images from these modified versions, it learns to identify and remove anomalies during inference.

During inference, when presented with an unhealthy image containing a real anomaly (e.g., a tumor), the DDPM treats the anomaly as an artificial perturbation and tries to remove it, generating a healthy version of the image. The difference between the generated healthy image and the original unhealthy image is then used to create an anomaly map, highlighting the location of the anomaly.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the masking approaches used in the paper from a more conventional computer vision perspective. Let me know if you have any further questions!

And can you explain how this related to diffusion denoising - like how does it fit with the conventional training approach where a model learns to denoise an image. Do they denoise the masked area or what?

Can you explain in some detail please with reference to what they outline in the article

Certainly! Let's dive into how the masking approaches relate to the conventional training approach of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and how they are used in the article.

In the conventional training approach of DDPMs, the goal is to learn a model that can denoise an image. The training process involves the following steps:

1. Start with a clean image.
2. Gradually add random Gaussian noise to the image over a fixed number of timesteps, creating a sequence of increasingly noisy images.
3. Train the DDPM to reverse this noising process, i.e., to denoise the noisy images and reconstruct the original clean image.

The DDPM is trained to estimate the noise added at each timestep and subtract it from the noisy image, progressively denoising the image until it reaches the original clean image.

Now, let's see how the masking approaches fit into this training scheme:

1. Image Patch-Masking (IPM):
In IPM, the authors apply a mask to random patches of the clean image before adding noise. The masked patches are set to zero, effectively removing the information in those regions.

The masked image is then subjected to the normal noising process of DDPM. The DDPM is trained to denoise the noisy masked image and reconstruct the original clean image, including the masked patches.

During training, the DDPM learns to fill in the missing information in the masked patches based on the surrounding context. This encourages the DDPM to learn a more robust representation of the image structure and to effectively denoise the image, even in the presence of missing information.

2. Frequency Patch-Masking (FPM):
In FPM, the masking is performed in the frequency domain. The clean image is first transformed into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The authors then apply a mask to certain frequency components, suppressing or removing those components.

The modified frequency representation is then converted back to the spatial domain using the inverse FFT, resulting in a modified clean image. This modified image is then subjected to the normal noising process of DDPM.

The DDPM is trained to denoise the noisy modified image and reconstruct the original clean image. By masking in the frequency domain, the DDPM learns to capture and reconstruct the important frequency components of the image, even when some components are missing.

3. Frequency Patch-Masking CutMix (FPM-CM):
FPM-CM combines FPM with the CutMix technique. The authors first apply FPM to the clean image, obtaining a modified image in the frequency domain. They then randomly select patches from the modified image and paste them onto the corresponding locations in the original clean image.

The resulting composite image, which contains both clean and modified patches, is then subjected to the normal noising process of DDPM. The DDPM is trained to denoise the noisy composite image and reconstruct the original clean image.

By training on these composite images, the DDPM learns to identify and remove the modified patches, effectively treating them as anomalies. This helps the DDPM to better distinguish between normal and anomalous regions during inference.

In all three masking approaches, the DDPM is trained to denoise the masked or modified areas of the image and reconstruct the original clean image. The masking serves as a regularization technique that encourages the DDPM to learn a more robust and context-aware representation of the image structure.

During inference, when presented with an unhealthy image containing a real anomaly, the DDPM perceives the anomaly as a noisy or modified region and tries to denoise and remove it, generating a healthy version of the image. The difference between the generated healthy image and the original unhealthy image is then used to create an anomaly map.

The authors demonstrate that by incorporating these masking approaches into the training of DDPMs, they can improve the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans compared to existing methods.

So in a way the model learns to denoise and fill in at the same time? or I guess being 0 valued is the same as noise?

***
Yes, you're right! In the context of the masking approaches used in the paper, setting the pixel values to zero in the masked regions can be thought of as a special type of noise or corruption.

In the conventional denoising training of DDPMs, the model learns to remove Gaussian noise that is explicitly added to the clean images. The noise is random and distributed across the entire image.

In the masking approaches, specifically Image Patch-Masking (IPM), the authors introduce a different type of corruption by setting specific patches of the image to zero. This can be seen as a more structured form of noise, where certain regions of the image are completely masked out.

By training the DDPM to reconstruct the original clean image from the masked version, the model effectively learns to fill in the missing information in the masked regions based on the surrounding context. This is similar to the concept of inpainting, where the goal is to fill in missing or corrupted parts of an image based on the available information.

So, in the IPM approach, the DDPM simultaneously learns to denoise the image (by removing the Gaussian noise added during the noising process) and to fill in the missing information in the masked regions. The model learns to leverage the context and structure of the image to reconstruct the complete, clean image.

In the Frequency Patch-Masking (FPM) approach, the masking is applied in the frequency domain, where certain frequency components are suppressed or removed. This can also be thought of as a form of corruption or noise, but in the frequency domain rather than the spatial domain.

The Frequency Patch-Masking CutMix (FPM-CM) approach combines FPM with the CutMix technique, where patches from the modified image are pasted onto the clean image. This introduces a different type of anomaly or corruption, where the DDPM learns to identify and remove these anomalous patches during the denoising process.

In all these cases, the DDPM learns to denoise the image by removing the explicitly added Gaussian noise, while also learning to fill in or reconstruct the missing or corrupted information introduced by the masking approaches. The masking serves as a regularization technique that encourages the DDPM to learn a more robust and context-aware representation of the image structure.

So, you're correct in understanding that the model learns to denoise and fill in the missing information at the same time, and that setting pixel values to zero can be considered a special type of noise or corruption in the context of these masking approaches.
